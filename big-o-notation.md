#BIG-O NOTATION

.big-o is methodology for figuring out how to solve a problem with a function
.write a function that takes in a number and returns the sum of that number from 1 to that number.

so 4 would return 10

1 would return 1

2 would return 3
//This is called "Linear Growth"
function num(x){ 
    sum = 0
	for(i = 0; i < num.length; i++) {
		return sum = sum + 1;
	}
}
num(1);

.everytime you run a function to the block chain, that costs money, so making it efficient as possible is super important.

//this is called "Constant Growth"
function sumUpto(a) {
    return a(a+1)/2;
} //1 step no matter what argument i pass

.ALWAYS THING ABOUT HOW MANY STEPS YOUR FUNCTION IS TAKING AND ASK YOURSELF IF THERE IS A MORE EFFICIENT WAY THAT INVOLVES FEWER STEPS.
